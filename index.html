		<h3>Here are some other math related websites</h3>
		<a href="http://www.mathplayground.com/">Math Games</a> <br>
		<a href="http://www.basic-mathematics.com/basic-math-formulas.html">Math Formulas</a>
		<p>The latter site, "Math Formulas" is an example of a poorly designed site. Much of the formatting seems to be done in HTML which is not ideal. There are also a lot of formulas being thrown together with spacing and not with proper sectioning or block elements. THe site if fairly basic but it does have a decent amount of meta data and a cool live traffic feed.</p>
